## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

Before beginning any project i like to look at the design and break it down, usually ill
do it on paper to help me visualize. I do this to help me get an idea of what divs need to
be inside of containers. For example on this project I knew that I would have 
to put the form elements in its own container, the return line its own container, the 
results its own container, and on top of all that these elemtents would have to be wrapped in a container. 
This process makes it so much easier to style.


### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

  I learned that defer is a boolean attribute that when set specifies that the 
  script is downloaded parallel to parsing the page and executed after the page has been loaded.

### Continued development

  I'm defenitley going to continue working on conditional statements, they can be tricky
  but very satisfying when you get them to run properly.

### Useful resources

Resource#1: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/
  This resource helps save time, I just copy and paste and my CSS reset 
  is ready to go.
  
Resource#2: https://www.w3schools.com/
  I use this resource for when I need a refresher on certain things like how to add place holders
  and hover effects. It helps me get out of trouble like explaining the difference between let and const variables.
